     <p>The <a href="https://swagger.io/specification/">OpenAPI Specification</a> is a standardised way of describing RESTful web APIs, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recommended-open-standards-for-government/describing-restful-apis-with-openapi-3">is recommended</a> by the government Open Standards Board.</p>

    <p>It allows you to produce a file (the OpenAPI document) which is both machine and human readable, and which describes the format and responses of your API.
    </p>

    <p>A good principle is to produce an OpenAPI document as the first output of your design process, and then develop the document along with the API design.
    </p>

    <p>This will help to:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>show the API has been developed consistently with others from your organisation
      </li>
      <li>test the API against rules and for security issues <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-devsecops-guideline/latest/01b-Linting-Code#:~:text=Linting%20is%20the%20automated%20checking,(otherwise%20known%20as%20linter).">using a software linter</a>
      </li>
      <li>generate reference documentation automatically â€“ documentation generated in this way should be <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-document-apis">supported by further resources</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>For non-REST APIs like GraphQL, you should still look to produce a specification during the design process. For example, for GraphQL this would be a GraphQL schema specification defining the types available, queries, mutations and the relationships between them.
