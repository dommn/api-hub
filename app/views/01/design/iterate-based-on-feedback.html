   <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery">Follow an agile process</a> when designing your API. You do this by incrementally building out your design and continuously testing it and getting feedback from the people who will be consuming it.
  </p>

  <p>At the design stage itâ€™s easy to make changes to your API. You can entirely remove endpoints and redefine their response formats without worrying about breaking changes.
  </p>

  <p>Once your API is built and people start using it, it becomes much harder to make big changes because you need to consider backward compatibility between versions of your API.
