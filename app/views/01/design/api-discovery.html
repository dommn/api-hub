      <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">API discovery</h1>

      <p>Before you commit to designing a new API, you need to understand the problem that needs to be solved.</p>

      <p>That means learning about:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>who are your users and what are their <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/start-by-learning-user-needs">user needs</a></li>
        <li>what users need from your API to achieve their goal by doing <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/user-research-in-discovery">user research</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>This part of your project is called the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works">discovery phase</a>.</p>

      <p>For an API, the user is usually a developer who wants to consume your API to deliver a service. The developer will have needs based on:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the service they are developing</li>
        <li>how easy it is to write code to consume your API</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Making your API easy to understand means itâ€™s more likely to be used.  The information you gather through the discovery phase will allow you to focus on the functionality that meet user needs. </p>
