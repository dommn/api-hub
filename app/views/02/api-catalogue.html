    <p>This catalogue is for APIs published by public sector organisations in the UK.</p>

    <p>Collecting a list of government APIs helps us understand:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
   <li>what APIs are published</li>
    <li>where API development is taking place</li>
    <li>whether APIs are suitable for reuse</li>
  </ul>

    <p>The API catalogue also helps users across government find and access inter-departmental data exchanges, as well as sharing best practice in API development.</p>
    
    <p>All of the APIs and data sources published in the catalogue have their own licensing and access restrictions. Check the documentation for each individual API for more details.</p>
