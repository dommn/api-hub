      <p>An API management strategy can:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
     <li> provide visibility of all your APIs, which helps people discover them and promotes reusing existing technology </li>
     <li>allow you to standardise common design patterns </li>
     <li>help you automate administrative and operational tasks</li>
     <li>provide a central place for your users to access API documentation and support</li>
     <li>provide data and metrics to help you understand your APIâ€™s performance and usage</li>
     <li>help you implement and maintain good security and data protection practices</li>
    </ul>

      <p>Your API management strategy should cover the full life cycle of APIs, from design to retirement. </p>
