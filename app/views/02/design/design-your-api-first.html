      <p>API first is the practice of designing software starting with an API, before designing your web or mobile user interface.</p>
      <p>Developing the API before the rest of the service means a platform or service can be built around the API. This will reduce the need to repeat work, if later on an API is required for your service.</p>
      <p>APIs are often an afterthought – built when a service already exists, as a way for other services to access its data. If you’re building an API to a legacy system, that may be your only choice, but you should still think about the user needs for your API.</p>
      <p>Developing your API before any other interfaces has other advantages, including:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>other services being able to use your API</li>
        <li>stress-testing of your API by your own internal services, allowing you to make continuous improvements – this will improve developer experience by exposing the complexities of the API and making sure, for example, that documentation is fit for purpose</li>
        <li>improved modularity and reuse of code, as the API will not have to be customised to fit an existing service – this leads to more consistent interfaces, meaning developers can be more comfortable with your API and can speed up integration</li>
        <li>the resources your API exposes will be fit for purpose – by starting with the API, it means that the business logic of your service can be clearly separated from the data structures used in any underlying data store</li>
      </ul>
